        <break>
          <break>
      		<p>I'm from Albany, New York and I am a junior computer science major at Cornell University in the College of Engineering. I will be graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in the year 2024. </p>
          <break>
            <p> Over the Summer in 2021, I worked as a software 
            research intern at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. For this job, I learned to utilize the Apache Arrow package using Python to research its effectiveness in processing large amounts of data. To analyze this, I wrote and compiled code to record memory and performance of Apache Arrow's dictionary encoding and compression methods by testing over 30GB of data, using several different data sources. You can find my research results and code <a href="https://github.com/sabrinali2002/Apache-Arrow-Project">here.</a></p>
            <break>
              <p> I have been a student technology assistant at Cornell's Center for Teaching Innovation (CTI) since August, 2021. Students a part of STAP (Student Technology Assistant Program), work directly with faculty and instructional staff to integrate technology in their courses by helping them modernize old technologies and media, digitizing audio and video projects, and providing telephone support on any Canvas or iClicker related issues. </p>
            <break>
            	<p> This Summer, however, I will be giving myself a break to travel, work on self-improvement, and relax before getting back into classes again. There's only so many free Summers you have after all haha.
            	</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I have many hobbies and interests including playing the piano, the violin, and the guitar, coding, baking, and drawing! In the future, I plan on learning some more instruments and getting back into reading books.</p>

    <break>
       <p style = "text-align: left; margin: 30px 0px 20px 10px;"> This was a project that took around 2 months which I and two of my friends created as part of our 3110 class OCaml class. Using functional programming was a new challenge that we were able to step through and what resulted was this game!</p>

    <break>
    <p style = "text-align: left; margin: 30px 20px 0px 10px;"> This group GUI project coded in Java simulates a simple world of critters that wander around, eat food, reproduce, and evolve! Critters move around on a hexagonal grid and need energy to survive. They gain a little energy from the sun in each time step as long as they are not moving. Critters may also attack each other. When critters run out of energy, they die and become food for other critters. If critters accumulate enough energy, they can reproduce.</p>
    <break>
       <p style = "text-align: left; margin: 30px 20px 0px 10px;"> The simulation is implemented as a networked Java service with a graphical front end. This design permits multiple users to view and interact with the same virtual world. </p>

It has been through many modifications throughout the years as more projects have been added on. Originally, I started it just to show my art portfolio in high school, but now it has developed into something more to describe me as a whole.</p>
    <break>
       <p style = "text-align: left; margin: 30px 0px 20px 10px;"> It includes my resume, github account, linkedin, and instagram that you can see on the left side bar when you click the pdf icon, some of my art pieces (scroll down), and much more! </p>

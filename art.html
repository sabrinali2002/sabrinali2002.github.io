			      <img src="Ruby.png" alt="Sakura" style="width:100%">
			      <h3>Sakura</h3>
			      <p>This is the first drawing in a series that I am calling "Project Ruby." It is based on a character I created, and the outfit theme is off-the-shoulder or sleevless tops indifferent shades of red.</p>
			    </div>
			  </div>
			  <div class="row">
			    <div class="content">
			      <img src="mikasa.png" alt="Mikasa" style="width:100%">
			      <h3>Mikasa</h3>
			      <p>Mikasa Ackerman is one of the main characters of Attack on Titan and is always shown with the scarf around her neck given to her by childhood friend, Eren. I really liked this one and I spent a lot of time trying to make the hair look right. </p>
			    </div>
			  </div>
			   <div class="row">
			    <div class="content">
			      <img src="armin.png" alt="Armin" style="width:100%">
			      <h3>Colossal Titan</h3>
			      <p> The mask actually did not take as long as I thought it would and the new outfit was really hard to draw but I'm happy with it. He's all grown up. No more mushroom hair thank god. </p>
			    </div>
			  </div>
			  <div class="row">
			    <div class="content">
			      <img src="PETRA.jpg" alt="Magic" style="width:100%">
			      <h3>Magic</h3>
			      <p>This is actually the first complete and official drawing I have ever done on with a drawing tablet. It was meant to be the beginning of the Ruby series, but I eventually scratched it after a few times because the character looked too much like a character I already knew from a tv show.</p>
			    </div>
			  </div>
			  <div class="row">
			    <div class="content">
			      <img src="art1.jpg" alt="Dark Thoughts" style="width:100%">
			      <h3>Dark thoughts</h3>
			      <p>This pastel drawing was part of my art concentration at school where I drew people playing musical instruments. It features my friend, Joyce, playing the cello. I named it dark thoughts to match with the monotone background and overall color scheme.</p>
			    </div>
			  </div>
			  <div class="row">
			    <div class="content">
			      <img src="tv children watching.jpg" alt="TV" style="width:100%">
			      <h3>Watching TV</h3>
			      <p>I actually did illustrations for a children's book called "Prepared for Trouble" which you can find on amazon. This was the drawing for the first chapter of the book, and I was a bit proud of it because I almost never drew realistically from my imagination.</p>
			    </div>

			<div class = "column">
			  <div class="row">
			    <div class="content">
			    <img src="blue.png" alt="Midnight" style="width:100%">
			      <h3>Midnight</h3>
			      <p>The second drawing in the series shows her playing the guitar late at night. The dress would be a very very dark shape of red, almost black, and the drawing reflects what I wish I could be doing instead of studying late at night.</p>
			    </div>

			    <div class="content">
			      <img src="mikasafinal.png" alt="Mikasa" style="width:100%">
			      <h3>Badass</h3>
			      <p>This started off as just a doodle that I made after I turned in my final assignment in my first semester of college but I really like how the black and white effect turned out!</p>
			    </div>
			  </div>
			  <div class="row">
			    <div class="content">
			      <img src="3 PEOPLE final.jpg" alt="3 soldiers" style="width:100%">
			      <h3>3 soldiers</h3>
			      <p>These are the 3 main characters of Attack on Titan: Eren, Mikasa, and Armin. It is my favorite show of all time and I really enjoyed drawing it. It actually originated from a small doodle that I was doing during class.</p>
			    </div>
			  </div>
			   <div class="row">
			    <div class="content">
			      <img src="eremika.png" alt="Eremika" style="width:100%">
			      <h3>Eremika</h3>
			      <p>They are my favorite pairing and no, I do not support Eren and anyone else. I know they will have a really sad ending and I will not be happy with it but I hope that in the end Mikasa will still become the person she was before and be happier with the life that she has. </p>
			    </div>
			  </div>
			  <div class="row">
			    <div class="content">
			      <img src="art4.jpg" alt="Passionate" style="width:100%">
			      <h3>Passionate</h3>
			      <p>This was my favorite piece in my art concentration on music, feauturing my friend Paul playing the electric guitar. It's meant to be very fiery and exciting, which is why I named it "Passionate."</p>
			    </div>
			  </div>
			  <div class="row">
			    <div class="content">
			      <img src="2 Hand writing.jpg" alt="Listed" style="width:100%">
			      <h3>Listed</h3>
			      <p>This was the drawing for the second chapter of the book "Prepared for Trouble." I was really happy with the way the hand turned out.</p>
			    </div>
			  </div>

			<div class = "column">
			  <div class="row">
			    <div class="content">
			    <img src="Sunset.png" alt="Sunset" style="width:100%">
			      <h3>Sunset</h3>
			      <p>This was the third drawing in Project Ruby. I really experimented with lighting on this one and I thought that the backgorund was nicely planned because I'm usually not good with drawing backgrounds myself. In this, Ruby dons a pink dress with a lot of lace patterning and some sequins scattered throughout her dress.</p>
			    </div>
			  </div>
			  <div class="row">
			    <div class="content">
			      <img src="sasha2.png" alt="Sasha" style="width:100%">
			      <h3>In Loving Memory</h3>
			      <p>It took a long time to prepare this drawing because of all the colors and lightings that I had to change, but I really like how it turned out. Sasha was a brave and amazing potato girl who had a lot more to live for. It was hard for it to end the way it did.</p>
			    </div>
			  </div>
			  <div class="row">
			    <div class="content">
			      <img src="eren.png" alt="Eren" style="width:100%">
			      <h3>Eren</h3>
			      <p>This drawing is probably the one I was able to finish in the least amount of time. I finished this in one day after feeling inspired by the recent chapter that had come out on the manga Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan). The background also has a very deep meaning as well.</p>
			    </div>
			  </div>
			  <div class="row">
			    <div class="content">
			      <img src="yellow.png" alt="ferris wheel" style="width:100%">
			      <h3>Cheers</h3>
			      <p>This drawing, the third part of the Ruby series made me really happy when I finished it because it took an incredible amount of time with all the details it included. Each flower on the dress I had to place and desig myself and it was a lot of work. But in the end, I really liked how the character and the background integrated together.</p>
			    </div>
			  </div>
			  <div class="row">
			    <div class="content">
			      <img src="art6.jpg" alt="Saratoga" style="width:100%">
			      <h3>Saratoga</h3>
			      <p>This is a pastelle drawing that I entered into the scholastic art competition. I was able to receive and honorable mention. It was a drawing that my dad started and wanted me to finish after he left for China.</p>
			    </div>
			  </div>
			  <div class="row">
			    <div class="content">
			      <img src="backpack.jpg" alt="Backpack" style="width:100%">
			      <h3>Backpack problem</h3>
			      <p>This is also one of the chapter headers for the book I illustrated for. I think the characters' facial expressions are really comical and honestly I could've done a lot better. It was a good learning experience though.</p>
